## What is this about?

This is my personal page. For fun, I decided to create a horizontally scrolling page
using plain HTML+CSS+JS (and a tiny bit of jQuery & Typed.js) for simplicity. This
page does not serve any needs to demonstrate skills with TypeScript, Webpack, SCSS & other kung-fu words.
The page is created for fun and to be noticed a little bit more.
